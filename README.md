# Peas in a Podcast

Submission for Turing School of Software and Design, Backend Module 2 solo project: [Relational Rails](https://backend.turing.edu/module2/projects/relational_rails).

This program demonstrates a one-to-many database relationship using podcasts (one) and episodes (many), utilizing PostgreSQL as database infrastructure, and uses Ruby v2.7.4 and Rails v5.2.8 as a framework. 

In testing, I primarily utilized [rspec-rails](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs), [capybara](http://teamcapybara.github.io/capybara/), and [shoulda-matchers](https://matchers.shoulda.io/) for both feature and model testing.
